# 100 Days of Code

I'll start with 100 days of code once I'm finished with the IVP series. I need a plan as to what to do in those 100 days:

1. Develop and launch my website.
2. Develop a basic crud app
3. Develop pecunia
4. Build Binary Matters blog
5. Build Small Things blog

In addition to this, write a series of blog posts for Binary Matters, and transfer all tumblr posts to Small Things.
